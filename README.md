# 🌟 My Personal Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website. This is where I showcase my journey through the digital world, mixing data science, AI, and a bit of personal flair.

## 🎯 What's This About?

This isn't just another boring portfolio - it's a visual representation of my life as a Data Scientist who loves exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Think of it as my digital fingerprint (literally, check out the contact section! 😄).

## 🚀 Features

- **Clean, Modern Design**: Because who says data scientists can't have style?
- **Interactive Sections**: Smooth scrolling, typewriter effects, and subtle animations
- **No Social Media Links**: Well, except LinkedIn and Telegram - I keep it professional(ish)
- **Easter Eggs**: There might be an unreleased film hidden somewhere... 👀

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (keeping it simple and fast)
- Google Fonts for that crisp typography
- Intersection Observer API for smooth scroll animations
- A lot of coffee and Claude Opus 4 but also my best visual art creator Nano Banana
